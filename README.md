# Mazer

Elixir-y version of the mazes book which was originally Ruby.

Very much a work in progress. Mostly this has become a primer on what happens when something is build in Object-Orientation, and attempting to change it over to Elixir's Functional way. Like a caveman.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `mazer` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:mazer, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/mazer](https://hexdocs.pm/mazer).
